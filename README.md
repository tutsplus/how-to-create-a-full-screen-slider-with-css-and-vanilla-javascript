### Instructor: [Adi Purdila](https://tutsplus.com/authors/adi-purdila)

A slider is a very popular UI pattern and is very useful for displaying large amounts of information without taking up too much space. While there are hundreds of sliders you can download, it’s actually really easy to create your own and this is exactly what you’ll learn in this course.

In the first chapter you’ll learn how to create a CSS-only full-screen slider and in the second chapter you’ll add more advanced functionality to it with vanilla JavaScript and you’ll also learn how to add some nicer styling.
